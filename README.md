# urantia-quantum-sim
A specialized Quantum Chemistry application that bridges the gap between modern particle physics and the cosmology described in **The Urantia Book**. Using the **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**, this tool simulates the stable bonding energy of a Hydrogen molecule while exploring the theoretical "Electronic Stage" of matter.
